\details{
\subsection{Diversity}{

Alpha diversity is a joint quantity that combines elements or community
richness and evenness. Diversity increases, in general, when species richness
or evenness increase.

The following diversity indices are available:

\itemize{

\item 'coverage': Number of species needed to cover a given fraction of
the ecosystem (50 percent by default). Tune this with the threshold
argument.

\item 'faith': Faith's phylogenetic alpha diversity index measures how
long the taxonomic distance is between taxa that are present in the sample.
Larger values represent higher diversity. Using this index requires
rowTree. (Faith 1992)

If the data includes features that are not in tree's tips but in
internal nodes, there are two options. First, you can keep those features,
and prune the tree to match features so that each tip can be found from
the features. Other option is to remove all features that are not tips.
(See \code{only.tips} parameter)

\item 'fisher': Fisher's alpha; as implemented in
\code{\link[vegan:diversity]{vegan::fisher.alpha}}. (Fisher et al. 1943)

\item 'gini_simpson': Gini-Simpson diversity i.e. \eqn{1 - lambda},
where \eqn{lambda} is the
Simpson index, calculated as the sum of squared relative abundances.
This corresponds to the diversity index
'simpson' in \code{\link[vegan:diversity]{vegan::diversity}}.
This is also called Gibbs–Martin, or Blau index in sociology,
psychology and management studies. The Gini-Simpson index (1-lambda)
should not be
confused with Simpson's dominance (lambda), Gini index, or
inverse Simpson index (1/lambda).

\item 'inverse_simpson': Inverse Simpson diversity:
\eqn{1/lambda} where \eqn{lambda=sum(p^2)} and p refers to relative
abundances.
This corresponds to the diversity index
'invsimpson' in vegan::diversity. Don't confuse this with the
closely related Gini-Simpson index

\item 'log_modulo_skewness': The rarity index characterizes the
concentration of species at low abundance. Here, we use the skewness of
the frequency
distribution of arithmetic abundance classes (see Magurran & McGill 2011).
These are typically right-skewed; to avoid taking log of occasional
negative skews, we follow Locey & Lennon (2016) and use the log-modulo
transformation that adds a value of one to each measure of skewness to
allow logarithmization.

\item 'shannon': Shannon diversity (entropy).

}
}

\subsection{Dominance}{

A dominance index quantifies the dominance of one or few species in a
community. Greater values indicate higher dominance.

Dominance indices are in general negatively correlated with alpha diversity
indices (species richness, evenness, diversity, rarity). More dominant
communities are less diverse.

The following community dominance indices are available:

\itemize{

\item 'absolute': Absolute index equals to the absolute abundance of the
most dominant n species of the sample (specify the number with the argument
\code{ntaxa}). Index gives positive integer values.

\item 'dbp': Berger-Parker index (See Berger & Parker 1970) calculation
is a special case of the 'relative' index. dbp is the relative abundance of
the most
abundant species of the sample. Index gives values in interval 0 to 1,
where bigger value represent greater dominance.

\deqn{dbp = \frac{N_1}{N_{tot}}}{%
dbp = N_1/N_tot} where \eqn{N_1} is the absolute abundance of the most
dominant species and \eqn{N_{tot}} is the sum of absolute abundances of all
species.

\item 'core_abundance': Core abundance index is related to core species.
Core species are species that are most abundant in all samples, i.e., in
whole data set. Core species are defined as those species that have
prevalence over 50\\%. It means that in order to belong to core species,
species must be prevalent in 50\\% of samples. Core species are used to
calculate the core abundance index. Core abundance index is sum of relative
abundances of core species in the sample. Index gives values in interval
0 to 1, where bigger value represent greater dominance.

\deqn{core_abundance = \frac{N_{core}}{N_{tot}}}{%
core_abundance = N_core/N_tot} where \eqn{N_{core}} is the sum of absolute
abundance of the core species and \eqn{N_{tot}} is the sum of absolute
abundances of all species.

\item 'gini':  Gini index is probably best-known from socio-economic
contexts (Gini 1921). In economics, it is used to measure, for example, how
unevenly income is distributed among population. Here, Gini index is used
similarly, but income is replaced with abundance.

If there is small group of species
that represent large portion of total abundance of microbes, the inequality
is large and Gini index closer to 1. If all species has equally large
abundances, the equality is perfect and Gini index equals 0. This index
should not be confused with Gini-Simpson index, which quantifies diversity.

\item 'dmn': McNaughton’s index is the sum of relative abundances of the two
most abundant species of the sample (McNaughton & Wolf, 1970). Index gives
values in the unit interval:

\deqn{dmn = (N_1 + N_2)/N_tot}

where \eqn{N_1} and \eqn{N_2} are the absolute
abundances of the two most dominant species and \eqn{N_{tot}} is the sum of
absolute abundances of all species.

\item 'relative': Relative index equals to the relative abundance of the
most dominant n species of the sample (specify the number with the
argument \code{ntaxa}).
This index gives values in interval 0 to 1.

\deqn{relative = N_1/N_tot}

where \eqn{N_1} is the absolute abundance of the most
dominant species and \eqn{N_{tot}} is the sum of absolute abundances of all
species.

\item 'simpson_lambda': Simpson's (dominance) index or Simpson's lambda is
the sum of squared relative abundances. This index gives values in the unit
interval. This value equals the probability that two randomly chosen
individuals belongs to the
same species. The higher the probability, the greater the dominance (See
e.g. Simpson 1949).

\deqn{lambda = \sum(p^2)}

where p refers to relative abundances.

There is also a more advanced Simpson dominance index (Simpson 1949).
However, this is not provided and the simpler squared sum of relative
abundances is used instead as the alternative index is not in the unit
interval and it is highly
correlated with the simpler variant implemented here.

\subsection{Evenness}{

Evenness is a standard index in community ecology, and it quantifies how
evenly the abundances of different species are distributed. The following
evenness indices are provided:

By default, this function returns all indices.

The available evenness indices include the following (all in lowercase):
\itemize{
\item 'camargo': Camargo's evenness (Camargo 1992)
\item 'simpson_evenness': Simpson’s evenness is calculated as inverse
Simpson diversity (1/lambda) divided by
observed species richness S: (1/lambda)/S.
\item 'pielou': Pielou's evenness (Pielou, 1966), also known as Shannon or
Shannon-Weaver/Wiener/Weiner
evenness; H/ln(S). The Shannon-Weaver is the preferred term; see
Spellerberg and Fedor (2003).
\item 'evar': Smith and Wilson’s Evar index (Smith & Wilson 1996).
\item 'bulla': Bulla’s index (O) (Bulla 1994).
}

Desirable statistical evenness metrics avoid strong bias towards very
large or very small abundances; are independent of richness; and range
within the unit interval with increasing evenness (Smith & Wilson 1996).
Evenness metrics that fulfill these criteria include at least camargo,
simpson, smith-wilson, and bulla. Also see Magurran & McGill (2011)
and Beisel et al. (2003) for further details.
}

\subsection{Richness}{

The richness is calculated per sample. This is a standard index in community
ecology, and it provides an estimate of the number of unique species in the
community. This is often not directly observed for the whole community but
only for a limited sample from the community. This has led to alternative
richness indices that provide different ways to estimate the species
richness.

Richness index differs from the concept of species diversity or evenness in
that it ignores species abundance, and focuses on the binary presence/absence
values that indicate simply whether the species was detected.

The function takes all index names in full lowercase. The user can provide
the desired spelling through the argument \code{\link{name}} (see examples).

The following richness indices are provided.

\itemize{

\item 'ace': Abundance-based coverage estimator (ACE) is another
nonparametric richness
index that uses sample coverage, defined based on the sum of the
probabilities
of the observed species. This method divides the species into abundant
(more than 10
reads or observations) and rare groups
in a sample and tends to underestimate the real number of species. The
ACE index
ignores the abundance information for the abundant species,
based on the assumption that the abundant species are observed regardless
of their
exact abundance. We use here the bias-corrected version
(O'Hara 2005, Chiu et al. 2014) implemented in
\code{\link[vegan:specpool]{estimateR}}.
For an exact formulation, see \code{\link[vegan:specpool]{estimateR}}.
Note that this index comes with an additional column with standard
error information.

\item 'chao1': This is a nonparametric estimator of species richness. It
assumes that rare species carry information about the (unknown) number
of unobserved species. We use here the bias-corrected version
(O'Hara 2005, Chiu et al. 2014) implemented in
\code{\link[vegan:specpool]{estimateR}}. This index implicitly
assumes that every taxa has equal probability of being observed. Note
that it gives a lower bound to species richness. The bias-corrected
for an exact formulation, see \code{\link[vegan:specpool]{estimateR}}.
This estimator uses only the singleton and doubleton counts, and
hence it gives more weight to the low abundance species.
Note that this index comes with an additional column with standard
error information.

\item 'hill': Effective species richness aka Hill index
(see e.g. Chao et al. 2016).
Currently only the case 1D is implemented. This corresponds to the exponent
of Shannon diversity. Intuitively, the effective richness indicates the
number of
species whose even distribution would lead to the same diversity than the
observed
community, where the species abundances are unevenly distributed.

\item 'observed': The \emph{observed richness} gives the number of species that
is detected above a given \code{detection} threshold in the observed sample
(default 0). This is conceptually the simplest richness index. The
corresponding index in the \pkg{vegan} package is "richness".

}
}

\subsection{Rarefaction}{

Rarefaction can be used to control uneven sequencing depths. Although,
it is highly debated method. Some think that it is the only option that
successfully controls the variation caused by uneven sampling depths.
The biggest argument against rarefaction is the fact that it omits data.

Rarefaction works by sampling the counts randomly. This random sampling
is done \code{niter} times. In each sampling iteration, \code{sample} number
of random samples are drawn, and alpha diversity is calculated for this
subset. After the iterative process, there are \code{niter} number of
result that are then averaged to get the final result.

Refer to Schloss (2024) for more details on rarefaction.
